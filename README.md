# YogaCharge Public API

This repository contains discussions, decisions and definitions for the public API used in the research project YogaCharge.

## Documentation

The root documentatiin can be found [here](doc/index.md) and is based on the [arc42 template](). As decisions are taken upon separate parts of the application, the documentation is extended to include said definitions.

## Decisions 

Ongoing decisions are discussed in the [issues section](https://github.com/RicardoMonteiroSimoes/yoga-charge-api/issues) of this repository. As this is an open API, anyone is welcome to contribute and share their ideas and arguments. Please be aware that most discussions will be in german, as this is the main language people use in the project.
